# Project: Testing using Jest Practice

Getting familiar with testing framework by building simple functions and testing them using Jest.
I've taken [How to Code: Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-simple-data-delftx-htc1x)
and [How to Code: Complex Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-complex-data-delftx-htc2x) courses,
so TDD is not new to me. I just wanted to get familiar with Jest.

Inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice).
